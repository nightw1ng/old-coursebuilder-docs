#summary How to modify the registration pages for your course.

<h1>Create Registration</h1>

<wiki:toc max-depth="2" />

== Registration page ==

When prospective students first visit your course, the app displays a registration page:

https://www.corp.google.com/~vpg/no_crawl/cb/registration-parts.png

=== What happens from this page ===

The sample registration page asks one question, the student's name.


The !RegisterHandler class is defined in {{{controllers/utils.py}}}. This class defines what happens when a person registers for the course. The class creates a student object and stores the student's name and their answer to the marketing question.

You can change the file {{{views/register.html}}} (described in the next section) to ask different questions. If you do, you must change the !RegisterHandler code to store the answers to your questions.

=== Page layout ===

This page consists of three areas:
  * The *header* contains 
    * Course icon and name of your course.
    * Horizontal navigation bar, with two tabs on the left (Home and Registration) and an area with the person's address and a Logout link.
  * The *content area* contains a form for the prospective student to fill out.
  * The *footer* contains two links -- one to your website and one to the privacy conditions and terms for your course.

The app uses two files to render this page:
  * {{{views/base_registration.html}}} defines the header and footer areas.  See [ModifyTemplate ModifyCourseTemplate].
  * {{{views/register.html}}} defines the content of the registration form. If you change the questions asked, you'll have to change the code that handles the answers.

== Registration confirmation page ==

=== Page layout ===

Once a prospective student submits the registration form, the app displays the registration confirmation page:

https://www.corp.google.com/~vpg/no_crawl/cb/registrationconfirmation-parts.png

This page displays one message if the student is registered. It displays another message if the class is full. You can change either of these messages.

This page consists of the same three areas as the registration page and uses these files to render the page:
  * {{{views/base_registration.html}}} defines the header and footer areas. Note this is the same file the registration form uses, guaranteeing that these two pages have the same general look and feel.  See [ModifyTemplate ModifyCourseTemplate].
  * {{{views/confirmation.html}}} defines the content of the registration form.

== Testing changes ==

Changes you make to any file in the {{{views}}} directory appear automatically in your running development server.

That is, after you make a change to one of these files, simply load (or reload) a page that uses that view and the change appears.
