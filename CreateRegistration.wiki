When prospective students first visit your course, the app displays a registration page:

https://www.corp.google.com/~vpg/no_crawl/cb/registration-parts.png

This page consists of three areas:
  * The *header* contains 
    * Course icon and name of your course.
    * Horizontal navigation bar, with two tabs on the left (Home and Registration) and an area with the person's address and a Logout link.
  * The *content area* contains a form for the prospective student to fill out.
  * The *footer* contains two links -- one to your website and one to the privacy conditions and terms for your course.

The app uses two files to render this page:
  * {{{views/base_registration.html}}} defines the header and footer areas.
  * {{{views/register.html}}} defines the content of the registration form.

Once a prospective student submits the registration form, the app displays the registration confirmation page:

https://www.corp.google.com/~vpg/no_crawl/cb/registrationconfirmation-parts.png

This page consists of the same three areas as the previous page and uses these files to render the page:
  * {{{views/base_registration.html}}} defines the header and footer areas. Note this is the same file the registration form uses, guaranteeing that these two pages have the same general look and feel.
  * {{{views/confirmation.html}}} defines the content of the registration form.

You need change these files to customize the app for your material. For details, see [CreateRegistration Create Registration].
