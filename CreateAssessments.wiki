#summary How to create assessments (graded tests) for your course.

<h1>Create Assessments</h1>

<wiki:toc />

At certain parts throughout the course, students take assessments to see how they're doing:

This page talks about the mechanics of creating an assessment. For information on what to put in your assessment, see [TwoDevelop#Decide_what_you_want_to_test_in_your_assessments,_both_graded_an Develop the Content without Technology].

== What happens on an assessment page ==

An assessment is a graded test, typically covering material from several units and lessons. With our experimental code, you have control over how many graded assessments you provide and how each of those assessments counts in the final scoring for a studentâ€™s grade.

When students submit an assessment, the code determines how they did on the assessment and provides the feedback you specify. It also stores the student score for later retrieval.

== Page layout ==

This page consists of three areas:
  * The *header* is the same as for the home page. See [ModifyTemplate Modify Course Template] for information about this file.
  * The *content area* contains the questions and answer areas and a submit button.
  * The *footer* is the same as for the home page. See [ModifyTemplate Modify Course Template] for information about this file.

The app uses three files to render this page:
  * {{{views/base.html}}} defines the header and footer areas.
  * {{{views/assessment.html}}} defines the structure of the content area.
  * {{{assets/js/assessment-}}}_*{{SUFFIX}}}*_{{{.js}}} contains a !JavaScript object that fills in the actual question and answer areas for the assessment. Each assessment has its own file.

== Writing assessments ==

An assessment contains explanatory text and one or more questions for the student.

You define each assessment in its own !JavaScript file. The filenames have the form {{{assessment-}}}_*{{{SUFFIX}}}*_{{{.js}}}, where _*{{{SUFFIX}}}*_ is one of {{{Pre}}}, {{{Mid}}}, or {{{Fin}}}.

The format of the file is
{{{
var assessment = {
  assessmentName: nameString,
  preamble: preambleString,
  checkAnswers: Boolean,
  questionsList: questionsArray
}
}}}

The file contains a single object named {{{assessment}}}. This object describes everything the code needs to know about an assessment. The attributes of the {{{assessment}}} object are as follows:

  * {{{assessmentName.}}} A string containing a unique name for this assessment. The code uses the assessment name to determine what special processing to do for an assessment. The possible values are {{{"precourse"}}}, {{{"midcourse"}}}, and {{{"postcourse"}}}. See [#Assessment_name Assessment name].
  * {{{preamble.}}} A string containing text and complete HTML elements. The preamble appears as the first thing on the assessment page.  See [#Preamble Preamble].
  * {{{checkAnswers.}}} A Boolean. If {{{True}}}, then students can check their answers before submission.  (Note that case is important in this value; it must be either {{{True}}} or {{{False}}}.) See [#Submitting_and_checking_answers Submitting and checking answers].
  * {{{questionsList.}}} An ordered array, each of whose elements describes a question in the assessment. The questions appear after the preamble. See [#Questions Questions]. 

=== Assessment name ===

The value of the {{{assessmentName}}} attribute is one of  {{{"precourse"}}}, {{{"midcourse"}}}, or {{{"postcourse"}}}.

When students complete an assessment, they see a message about how they did. You can change the contents of these messages in {{{views/test_confirmation.html}}}. (See [#Submitting_and_checking_answers Submitting and checking answers].)

=== Preamble ===

The value of the {{{preamble}}} attribute is a string that contains a set of complete HTML elements.  

That is, if the string contains an open HTML tag (such as {{{<em>}}}), it must also have the corresponding close tag (such as {{{</em>}}}).  

Also note that the entire string must be on a single line. If you want it to render as multiple lines, you must include the appropriate HTML markup.

The code simply renders the HTML you enter as the first thing on the assessment page. 

=== Submitting and checking answers ===

The bottom of an assessment page always includes a *Save Answers* button. When students submit an assessment by clicking on this button, they see a page such as the following:

http://wiki.course-builder.googlecode.com/git/images/assessment-submit.png

By default, this page acknowledges that they submitted the assessment and gives them information about next steps. You can change the messages for different assessments by changing the file at {{{views/test_confirmation.html}}}.

Notice that this page does not tell students how they did on the assessment or give any feedback about what they might want to study some more. You can give students the option of checking their answers before submitting an assessment. If you set the {{{checkAnswers}}} attribute of the {{{assessment}}} object to {{{True}}}, then the assessment page has an additional *Check your Answers* button and an area for feedback, as shown here:

http://wiki.course-builder.googlecode.com/git/images/assessment-check.png 

The feedback contains the student's score. If the student doesn't answer all questions correctly, the code displays which lessons the student should review to improve their score. How you specify this information is discussed in the next section.

=== Questions ===

The {{{questionsList}}} attribute is an ordered array of !JavaScript objects, each of which describes a question in the assessment.

Each question object has three attributes. Two of these are the same for all question types. Which third attribute you include determines what type of question this is.

The common attributes are:

  * {{{questionHTML.}}} A string containing text and complete HTML elements. This string is the text to display for this question. As with a preamble string, if this string contains an open HTML tag (such as {{{<em>}}}), it must also have the corresponding close tag (such as {{{</em>}}}). Also note that the entire string must be on a single line. If you want it to render as multiple lines, you must include the appropriate HTML markup.

  * {{{lesson.}}} A string representing the lesson (or lessons) that cover the material this question is about. The app displays this string if the student incorrectly answers the question and has requested the app to [#Submitting_and_checking_answers check answers].

A question can be one of four types, depending on the third attribute:

  * {{{choices.}}}  A multiple-choice question. The value of the {{{choices}}} attribute is an array of strings and one function call.  Each string represents a possible wrong answer to the question. You specify the correct answer by with a function call of the form {{{correct(}}}_*{{{string}}}*_{{{)}}}, where _*{{{string}}}*_ is a string containing the correct answer. Students see a set of radio buttons to choose from as with multiple-choice questions in [CreateActivities#Single_multiple-choice_question activities]. 

  * {{{correctAnswerNumeric.}}}   A number. For questions with a numeric answer. The value of the attribute is the correct answer.

  * {{{correctAnswerString.}}} A case-insensitive exact string match. For example, if the value is {{{"hello"}}}, then {{{Hello}}} and {{{hello}}} are both correct, but {{{HelloWorld}}} is incorrect. Use this attribute when your question requires a specific string answer.

  * {{{correctAnswerRegex.}}}  Free text. The value of this attribute is a regular expression capturing the correct answer. Use this attribute when your question is more open ended than a string match can handle. In this case, the code uses a [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions regular expression] to verify the answer. Regular expressions can be notoriously difficult for a programmer to get right. For this reason, you need to be very careful with the wording of any question that takes a free text answer. Your regular expression needs to account for reasonable variations in student responses.  

== Testing changes ==

Changes you make to any file in the {{{views}}} directory or to any file in the {{{assets/js}}} directory appear automatically in your running development server.

That is, after you make a change to one of these HTML or JavaScript files, simply load (or reload) a page that uses that page and the change appears.

A couple of hints for !JavaScript debugging:

  * Consider using a !JavaScript editor or IDE that highlights errors. 

  * If you use Google Chrome to test your app, consider using the !JavaScript console. (See [https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/console Chrome Developer Tools: Console].) The console shows fairly detailed information about !JavaScript parse errors.
