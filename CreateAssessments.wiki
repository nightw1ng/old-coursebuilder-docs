At certain parts throughout the course, students take assessments to see how they're doing. An assessment page has the simplest form of all:

https://www.corp.google.com/~vpg/no_crawl/cb/assessment.png

This page consists of three areas:
  * The *header* is the same as for the home page.
  * The *content area* contains the questions and answer areas and a submit button.
  * The *footer* is the same as for the home page.

The app uses three files to render this page:
  * {{{views/base.html}}} defines the header and footer areas.
  * {{{views/assessment.html}}} defines the structure of the content area.
  * {{{assets/js/assessment-}}}_*{{SUFFIX}}}*_{{{.js}}} contains a !JavaScript array that fills in the actual question and answer areas for the assessment. Each assessment has its own file.

// Usage instructions: Create a single variable named 'activity' consisting
// of a list of complete HTML elements (e.g., no opening tag without a closing
// tag) and JavaScript objects representing custom questions to render.
//
// When the activity page loads, activity-generic.js will render the contents
// of 'activity' into the enclosing HTML webpage.
