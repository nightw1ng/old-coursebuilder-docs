<h1>Create Assessments</h1>

At certain parts throughout the course, students take assessments to see how they're doing:

== What happens on an assessment page ==

An assessment is a graded test, typically covering material from several units and lessons. With our experimental code, you have control over how many graded assessments you provide and how each of those assessments counts in the final scoring for a studentâ€™s grade.

When students submit an assessment, the code determines how they did on the assessment and provides the feedback you specify. It also stores the student score for later retrieval.

== Page layout ==

This page consists of three areas:
  * The *header* is the same as for the home page. See [ModifyTemplate Modify Course Template] for information about this file.
  * The *content area* contains the questions and answer areas and a submit button.
  * The *footer* is the same as for the home page. See [ModifyTemplate Modify Course Template] for information about this file.

The app uses three files to render this page:
  * {{{views/base.html}}} defines the header and footer areas.
  * {{{views/assessment.html}}} defines the structure of the content area.
  * {{{assets/js/assessment-}}}_*{{SUFFIX}}}*_{{{.js}}} contains a !JavaScript array that fills in the actual question and answer areas for the assessment. Each assessment has its own file.


== Writing assessments ==


== Testing changes ==

Changes you make to any file in the {{{views}}} directory or to any file in the {{{assets/js}}} directory appear automatically in your running development server.

That is, after you make a change to one of these HTML or JavaScript files, simply load (or reload) a page that uses that page and the change appears.


== Sending email after assessments ==
