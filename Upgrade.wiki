  # Make a complete copy of your old version of Course Builder and all your data.
  # Download and unzip the latest version of Course Builder.
  # Copy the {{{/assets}}} and {{{/data}}} folders from your old version to the latest version. If you encounter visual oddities, check and adjust your .css file in {{{/assets/css}}}. New definitions may have been added or previous definitions changed.
  # Make the appropriate changes in your {{{course.yaml}}}.
  # Make the appropriate changes in your {{{course_template.yaml}}}.

  # In the [FAQ#What_is_a_shell_or_command_prompt? terminal], go to your new Course Builder root directory.
  # Use the [UploadCode#Upload_(or_deploy)_your_app appcfg.py] command to update your index by typing (do not forget the period at the end): {{{appcfg.py update_indexes .}}}

  # [UploadCode#Upload_(or_deploy)_your_app Deploy] your new version to Google App Engine.

=Upgrade notes from 1.5.0 on 1.5.1=
 * We suggest you use the {{{course_template.yaml}}} in version 1.5.1 and manually transfer the settings from your 1.5.0 {{{course_template.yaml}}}. This is due to the Search box definition placed in {{{course_template.yaml}}} in version 1.5.1.

 * There was a bug in those cases when a reviewer reviewed multiple assessments, only the last assessment that was submitted or saved as draft was recorded. This bug was fixed in 1.5.1 although the fix required a backwards-incompatible change that will break your course if you deploy 1.5.1 on a course that has preexisting review data.

=Upgrade from 1.3.1 to 1.4.0=
Before you deploy to Google App Engine with 1.4.0, you must update your index. First, use the same upgrade procedures as [Upgrade#Upgrade_from_1.2.x_to_1.3.0 upgrading to 1.3.0 from 1.2.x] except stop before the deployment step. In those instructions:
  * Replace 1.2.x with 1.3.1 
  * Replace 1.3.0 with 1.4.0

Next, before you deploy to Google App Engine:
  # In the [FAQ#What_is_a_shell_or_command_prompt? terminal], go to your new Course Builder root directory.
  # Use the [UploadCode#Upload_(or_deploy)_your_app appcfg.py] command to update your index by typing (do not forget the period at the end): {{{appcfg.py update_indexes .}}}

You are prompted for your email and application-specific password. There are no messages from Course Builder if you are successful. If you do not build/update your index, you see Google App Engine errors until you do so. 

You can track the statuses of your applications' indices by clicking on the *Datastore Indexes* menu item in the Google App Engine admin console.

While your indices are building, you see a screen similar to the following:

The time an index takes to build depends on the amount of data being indexed. For many users this will be fast. However, if you have a lot of data in the datastore you may have to wait for some time, up to days, for the indices to finish building. Plan ahead if you have lots of data. You only need to do this during a Course Builder upgrade.

When indices are ready to serve, you see a screen that looks like the following:

The important point is the text under *Status*. When it says *Serving*, you should no longer experience errors.

=Upgrade from 1.3.0 to 1.3.1=
Please use the same upgrade procedures as [Upgrade#Upgrade_from_1.2.x_to_1.3.0 upgrading to 1.3.0 from 1.2.x]. In those instructions:
  * Replace 1.2.x with 1.3.0
