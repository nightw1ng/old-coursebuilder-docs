#summary How to modify the My Profile tab.

<h1>Modify My Profile Tab</h1>

<wiki:toc max-depth="2" />

At any time, students can visit a profile page that displays information about their current status in the course and also lets them make some changes. This page looks as follows:

http://wiki.course-builder.googlecode.com/git/images/myprofile-parts.png

== Page layout ==

This page consists of three areas:
  * The *header* is the same as for the home page.
  * The *content area* contains the student profile.
  * The *footer* is the same as for the home page.

The app uses two files to render this page:
  * {{{views/base.html}}} defines the header and footer areas.  This page is used by all pages displayed to a registered student.
  * {{{views/student_profile.html}}} defines the structure of the content area.

== What happens from this page ==
 
This page displays information about student current status in the course and also lets students remove themselves from the course.

=== Student information ===

By default, the profile page displays some, but not all, of the information available in the {{{Student}}} object. You can choose to display more or less information. Details of the {{{Student}}} information is in [ExportCourseData Export Course Data].

Note that if you change the number of assessments for your course, you probably want to change what's displayed here. See  [CreateAssessments#Changing_the_number_of_assessments Changing number of assessments].

Also, the profile provides a form in which students can change the name they supplied upon registration. If you change registration to not ask for a name, consider removing this form. See [CreateRegistration Create Registration].

=== Course unenrollment ===

The bottom of the profile contains a button that allows a student to unenroll from the course. When students click on that button, they are first presented with a page that requests confirmation of intent to unenroll:

If they confirm that they want to unenroll, they see a confirmation of unenrollment:

The app uses two files to render each of these pages:
  * {{{views/base_registration.html}}} defines the header and footer areas.  This page is used by all pages displayed to an unregistered person. 
  * {{{views/unenroll_confirmation_check.html}}} defines the content of the page that asks for confirmation before unenrolling <br> {{{views/unenroll_confirmation.html}}} defines the content of the page that confirms the student is actually unenrolled.


== Testing changes ==

Changes you make to any file in the {{{views}}} directory appear automatically in your running development server. That is, after you make a change to one of these files, simply load (or reload) a page that uses that view and the change appears.

To see how to make these changes in your live, deployed course, see [UploadCode Deploy Your App].
