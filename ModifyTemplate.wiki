== Structure of any registered page ==

All pages that a registered student sees start from the same template, {{{views/base.html}}}. This template defines the overall HTML for a page and includes definitions for the header and footer areas.

  * The *header* contains 
    * Course icon and name of your course.
    * Horizontal navigation bar, with two tabs on the left (Course and Forum) and an area with the person's address and a Logout link.
  * The *footer* contains the same two links as for the registration pages. 

You change this header and footer once for all registered pages. 

== Structure of an unregistered page ==

The two pages an unregistered person can see use a different base template, {{{views/base_registration.html}}}, than do all of the other pages.  As with {{{views/base.html}}}, this template defines the overall HTML for these pages and includes definitions for the header and footer areas.

Much of this page starts out the same as {{{views/base.html}}}. The only difference is the tabs in the horizontal navigation in the header.
