#summary How to modify the two base template that all other pages in your app use.

= Modify Course Template =

This code uses _view_ files as templates to determine the look and feel of all of the pages in your app. The view files are HTML files defined in the {{{views/}}} directory.

The templates work together hierarchically. Every page displayed for your course starts from either the {{{base_registration.html}}} template (for unenrolled people) or the {{{base.html}}} template (for enrolled people). The two base templates define the overall HTML structure of a page. 

The other views, such as {{{activity.html}}}, fill in more structure for a specific type of page. Finally, files outside of {{{views}}} may fill in the content for a particular page, such as {{{activity-1.1.js}}}.

For more information on the structure of these pages, see [https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/templates Using templates] for an introduction and then check out the [http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs Jinja2 documentation].

== Structure of a registered page ==

All pages that a registered student sees start from the same template, {{{views/base.html}}}. This template defines the overall HTML for a page and includes definitions for the header and footer areas.

  * The *header* contains 
    * Course icon and name of your course.
    * Horizontal navigation bar, with two tabs on the left (Course and Forum) and an area with the person's address and a Logout link.
  * The *footer* contains the same two links as for the registration pages. 

You change this header and footer once for all registered pages.  In the file, every place you must make a change is marked with the string {{{FIXME}}}. The changes are:

  # Course name, for the title element. This string appears in your browser, as the name of the window or tab containing your course.
  # Code to collect analytics data for your course. See [ReachAndEngagementMetrics Reach and Engagement Metrics] for information on setting this up.
  # Logo image for the header.
  # Link to go with the logo.
  # Course name or description for the header.
  # Link and name of entity responsible for the course, for the footer.
  # Link to a relevant privacy policy and terms of service.

The numbers in the image show where this image appears on the screen. (The analytics code has no visible effect.)

== Structure of an unregistered page ==

The two pages an unregistered person can see start from a different base template, {{{views/base_registration.html}}}.  As with {{{views/base.html}}}, this template defines the overall HTML for these pages and includes definitions for the header and footer areas.

In the sample code, much of this template starts out the same as {{{views/base.html}}}. The only difference is the tabs in the horizontal navigation in the header.

You change this header and footer once for both registration pages.  In the file, every place you must make a change is marked with the string {{{FIXME}}}. The changes are the same as in {{{views/base.html}}} with one exception. There is no place to collect Analytics data about people visiting the registration pages.

You can, of course, make these pages look more different.

== Testing changes ==

Changes you make to any file in the {{{views}}} directory appear automatically in your running development server.

That is, after you make a change to one of these files, simply load (or reload) a page that uses that view and the change appears.
