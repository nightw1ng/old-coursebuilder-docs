Each unit may have  some number of activities. An activity page shares almost the same structure as a lesson page:

https://www.corp.google.com/~vpg/no_crawl/cb/activity.png

The only difference between a lesson page and an activity page (at least in look and feel) is that instead of a video for the main content, an activity has a summary of important points from the preceding lesson and has a set of questions, with places to answer the questions and to check your answers or get hints.

The app uses four files to render this page:
  * {{{views/base.html}}} is the same as for lessons.
  * {{{views/activity.html}}} defines the same parts as does {{{views/unit.html}}} for lessons. You probably want to be consistent in these files.
  * {{{assets/js/activity-}}}_*{{{N.M}}}*_{{{.js}}} contains a !JavaScript array that fills in the actual question and answer areas for the activity. Each activity section has its own file.


{{{
// An activity represents explanatory text and one or more questions to present
// to the student.
//
// Usage instructions: Create a single array variable named 'activity'. Each
// element in the array should itself be either
//
// -- a string containing a set of complete HTML elements. That is, if the
//      string contains an open HTML tag (such as <em>), it must also have the
//      corresponding close tag (such as </em>). You put the actual question
//      text in a string.
//
// -- a JavaScript object representing the answer information for a question.
//      That is, the object contains properties such as the type of question, a
//      regular expression indicating the correct answer, a string to show in
//      case of either correct or incorrect answers or to show when the student
//      asks for help.
