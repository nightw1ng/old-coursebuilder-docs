= Welcome to Course Builder! =

Course Builder packages the software and technology we used to build our [http://www.powersearchingwithgoogle.com Power Searching with Google] online course. The first time we offered Power Searching, 155,000 students registered and over 20,000 students completed the course.

Course Builder is our experimental first step in the world of online education. We hope you will use it to create your own online courses, whether they're for 10 students or 100,000 students. Course Builder contains software and instructions for presenting your [ImplementCourseMaterial course material], including student activities and assessments and instructions for using other Google products to create a [ManageCommunity course community] and to evaluate the [MeasureEfficacy effectiveness] of your course. To use it effectively, you should be an experienced course designer, with some familiarity with HTML and !JavaScript.

If you use Course Builder and have issues or feature requests, please report them in our [https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/issues/list Issues Tracker].
