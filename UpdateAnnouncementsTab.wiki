Course Builder provides an announcements tab for you to post course announcements.

We recommend that you add to this tab all announcements that you send to either an [CreateEmailList announcements email alias] or to a [WebForums community discussion forum]. This allows students to see all course announcements, even if they choose to not join an email elias or visit the forum.
 
The content of the announcements is in the file {{{views/announcements.html}}}. You must replace the sample announcements that come with the sample course.

If you would prefer to not have the announcements tab at all, you can remove the tab from {{{views/base.html}}}.
