#summary After you know what you want to deliver, implement it with code, documents, videos, and so on.

=Implement the Entire Course with the Technology= 

In [TwoDevelop step 2], you did most of the theoretical course development. Once you have a clear idea what you want to accomplish, it’s time to put it into the format you’ll use. At this point, you can create videos, implement assessments, set up your groups, and do all that other fun stuff. 

Some overall tips:
  * *Do not try to immediately create a beautiful, final, finished product.* <br>Instead, implement a rough version that contains all of the major material. Don’t polish the writing; don’t do final edits on the video. Keep in mind that the next step is to [FourPilot pilot your course] to see how well it works with an audience. When you do that, you discover things you want to change. Make sure your schedule allows you to do so and that you haven’t made such a big investment in certain parts of your implementation that you cannot afford to redo them when you discover that you need to.

  * *Online students don’t give you the feedback you’re used to.*<br>When you can see your students, as in a live class, you have a huge amount of input to guide what you do. You can see where they’re interested, where they get bored, and where they’re confused. When you do a webinar, you have much less input because you cannot see your students, but you still have some input in the form of chats or tweets happening during your presentation. However, you create all of the course material and decide on the exact delivery for your online course before you deliver it; you cannot change it on the fly. You get no feedback from your students to allow you to adjust the content. The most you can do is interact with your students using the [WebForum Community Discusion] and [InstructorLedCommunication Instructor Led Communication] mechanisms. And to also collect metrics to help improve future versions of the course.

  * *Take heart.*<br>If you’re an experienced classroom teacher, you know that in a class of 30, there’s usually one troublemaker, one student who progresses slowly, and one student who progresses quickly. If your MOOC reaches 30,000 students, that one troublemaker becomes 1,000 troublemakers, and so on. Keep your perspective. It’s still the same phenomenon.

  * *Separate basic from advanced material.*<br>Design the primary flow of your material for the middle ground of students -- not too easy and not too hard. You may decide that there is extra material that you want available to students at either end of the spectrum. You can put extra material in a variety of places, as discussed in  [InstructorLedCommunication Instructor Led Communication].

This is the only part of the process that is really specific to MOOCs.

And now that you’ve implemented your content, it’s time to move on to step 4, [FourPilot Pilot with your target audience].
