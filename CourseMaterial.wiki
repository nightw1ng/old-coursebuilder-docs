Should this page talk about:
  * Think about the entire user flow (course administration flow) -- what order are students encountering what?
    * If they donâ€™t have a google account, what do they do?
    * When do they get which email?
    * etc.
    * (remember that flow is not all about the content)
    * Be clear to the students what the course flow will be (perhaps talk about it in the very first video)
    * Event timeline spreadsheet was great, but people missed some of the information in it
  * Advanced and background material as forum posts or as separate mini-courses. (We haven't done the latter.) Alternatively, use G+ or blog posts to introduce material you won't test on.
  * Do you care about accessibility? Consider video captioning. Consider live captioning for HOAs. Think about the effect of using a screen reader for accessing text and assessments.
  * Consistency of lessons.  Make the first few minutes of every lesson deeply compelling so they'll want to stay.

If not, where do they fit?
