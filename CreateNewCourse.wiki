When you create a new course, it will be completely empty. You can however, import almost everything from an existing course that exists on the same Google App Engine instance.

If you want to modify the course name, URL prefix, course file system location, or Google App Engine namespace after you create the course, use the *gcb_courses_config* setting in the *Settings* tab on the Administrator Page. 

In the editor page, add a new course in the text box. You must specify the new course above the default {{{course:/:/}}}. That is, {{{course:/:/}}} must always be the final line in the text box.

The page describes in detail the syntax for adding a new course. Each course must be on its own line. You may have as many courses as you wish.
