<h1>Create New Courses</h1>
Create new courses by clicking the *Add Course* button in the *Courses* tab on the Administrator page.

When you create a new course, it is by default private, which means students cannot view it. To make your course public, go to *[Dashboard#Settings Dashboard] > Settings* and change the {{{now_available:}}} assignment to {{{True}}} in the {{{course.yaml}}} section.  That is, the line should look like:

{{{now_available: True}}}

All newly created courses will also be completely empty. You can however, import almost everything from an existing course that exists on the same Google App Engine instance.

If you want to modify the course name, URL prefix, course file system location, or Google App Engine namespace after you create the course, use the *gcb_courses_config* setting in the *Settings* tab on the Administrator Page. The page describes in detail the syntax for modifying a course. 

You can also add a new course through the *gcb_courses_config* setting. However, the suggested method is through the *Add Course* button because it is much easier. If you add a new course through the *gcb_courses_config* setting, you must specify it above the default {{{course:/:/}}}. That is, {{{course:/:/}}} must always be the final line in the text box. Each course must also be on its own line.
