#summary Lists the custom settings for courses, which is all done through the course.yaml file.

<h1>Customize Course Settings</h1>

By default, all the settings in Course Builder are generic or contain placeholder text.  You must change Course Builder settings so that they are specific to your course.  You can set all these items and more through two files: {{{course.yaml}}} and {{{course_template.yaml}}}. These files are located in the root directory of your Course Builder installation.

By default the setting to make your course public or private is not set. See [CreateNewCourse#Make_Courses_Viewable Make Courses Viewable] on how to set it.

== course.yaml ==
The following list illustrates the types of settings you will find in {{{course.yaml}}}.

  * {{{instructor_details:}}} Information about the instructor to display on the main page
  * {{{main_video:}}} Whether you want a video or an image on the main page. If you specify both, video will take priority. The path to the image directory must also be relative, not absolute. That is, {{{assets/img}}} not {{{/assets/img}}}.
