<h1>Course Builder in a Nutshell</h1>

<font color=red><<TODO redo this to match the new site organization.>></font>

Welcome to Course Builder! The rest of these Wiki pages go into a lot of detail about how to build your own MOOC using the Course Builder software and the other tools and processes that we used when we created [http://www.google.com/insidesearch/landing/powersearching.html Power Searching with Google].

This page doesn't go into any explanations. It simply lists all of the steps involved -- everything from your beginning planning stages, to downloading and changing the Course Builder code to setting up online office hours -- and provides links to other places with more information.

== A. [OnePlan Plan for 30 minutes.] ==
  # Define the problem statement and high-level goal of the course.
  # Identify your audience and your assumptions.
  # Define course objectives.
  # Consider course logistics.

== B. [TwoDevelop Develop content without the technology.] ==
  # Clarify your goals and non-goals for the course.
  # Clarify your assumptions about your students.
  # Write clear, specific objectives.
  # Decide what you want to test in your assessments, both graded and ungraded.
  # Decide what other metrics to collect for your course.
  # Sequence and organize your content into digestible chunks.
  # Verify your content with others.
