#summary Checklist of all steps to create a course using Course Builder.

<h1>Course Builder Checklist</h1>

The rest of these Wiki pages go into a lot of detail about how to build your own online course using the Course Builder software and the other tools and processes that we used when we created [http://www.google.com/insidesearch/landing/powersearching.html Power Searching with Google].

This page doesn't go into any explanations. It simply lists all of the steps involved -- everything from your beginning planning stages, to downloading and changing the Course Builder code to setting up online office hours -- and provides links to other places with more information.

== Prerequisites for using Course Builder ==

The current version of Course Builder is designed for technically-savvy course designers. In particular, we expect the following from users:

  * *Experience creating course material* either for a traditional live classroom or for a more traditional online class. 
  * *HTML familiarity.* 
  * *!JavaScript familiarity,* particularly !JavaScript arrays, simple objects, and regular expressions. Of these, regular expressions tend to be the biggest stumbling block. The [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions Mozilla Developer Network] has an introduction to regular expressions. 
  * *App Engine familiarity is a plus,* but it's not necessary.

Before you dive into creating your own course, consider reading [WhatsInACourse Parts of a Course Builder Course] and [CourseFlow Course Flow for Students] to get a quick overview of the terminology we use in talking about online courses you create using Course Builder.
