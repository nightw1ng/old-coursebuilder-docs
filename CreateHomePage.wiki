You create the home page with these two files:
  * {{{views/course.html}}} contains the structure of the home page.
  * {{{data/unit.csv}}} contains the list of units to appear on the home page.

You _must_ change this file to be relevant to your course.

== Structure of home page ==

{{{views/course.html}}} contains the structure of the home page. It consists of a short blurb and a list of units and assessments. For the list, this file contains the structure of how they are laid out {{{data/unit.csv}}} contains the actual text for the units to display in the list.

You must change the blurb to be relevant to your course. 

The general format of the course as defined in this file is 
  * pre-course assessment
  * three units
  * pre-course assessment
  * three units
  * final assessment

If that matches your content, you don't need to make any more changes to {{{views/course.html}}}. 

If you have different assessments, a different number of units, or the ordering is different, you must change this file to reflect that.

<font color=red><<TODO which I'm really not keen on explaining how to do.>></font>

== List of units and assessments ==

{{{data/unit.csv}}} contains the list of units to appear on the home page. The first line describes the content of the other lines:

  {{{unit_id,unit_title,release_date,now_available}}}

Each line after that contains the information for an individual unit, such as: 
  {{{3,Advanced techniques,available July 12,True}}}

When you edit the file, leave the first line as is. Replace all of the other lines with the information relevant to your course. Each line consists of:
  * {{{unit_id}}}: An integer representing which unit this is.
  * {{{unit_title}}}: The name of the unit.
  * {{{release_date}}}: When this release will be available to students.
  * {{{now_available}}}: Whether or not students should currently be able to access this unit.
