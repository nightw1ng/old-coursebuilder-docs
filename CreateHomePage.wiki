After successul registration, the student can click on *Home* in the navigation bar of the confirmation page to be taken to the home page for your course.

https://www.corp.google.com/~vpg/no_crawl/cb/homepage.png

You create the home page with these files:
  * {{{views/base.html}}} defines the header and footer areas.
  * {{{views/course.html}}} defines the structure of the content area.
  * {{{data/unit.csv}}} defines the actual content of the content area. 

You _must_ change these files to be relevant to your course.

== Structure of any registered page ==

All pages that a registered student sees start from the same template, {{{views/base.html}}}. This template defines the overall HTML for a page and includes definitions for the header and footer areas.

  * The *header* contains 
    * Course icon and name of your course.
    * Horizontal navigation bar, with two tabs on the left (Course and Forum) and an area with the person's address and a Logout link.
  * The *footer* contains the same two links as for the registration pages. 

You change this header and footer once for all registered pages. See [ModifyTemplate Modify Course Template].

== Structure of home page ==

{{{views/course.html}}} contains the structure of the home page. It consists of a short blurb and a list of units and assessments. For the list, this file contains the structure of how they are laid out {{{data/unit.csv}}} contains the actual text for the units to display in the list.

You must change the blurb to be relevant to your course. 

The general format of the course as defined in this file is 
  * pre-course assessment
  * three units
  * pre-course assessment
  * three units
  * final assessment

If that matches your content, you don't need to make any more changes to {{{views/course.html}}}. 

If you have different assessments, a different number of units, or the ordering is different, you must change this file to reflect that.

<font color=red><<TODO which I'm really not keen on explaining how to do.>></font>

== List of units ==

{{{data/unit.csv}}} contains the list of units to appear on the home page. The first line describes the content of the other lines:

  {{{unit_id,unit_title,release_date,now_available}}}

Each line after that contains the information for an individual unit, such as: 
  {{{3,Advanced techniques,available July 12,True}}}

When you edit the file, leave the first line as is. Replace all of the other lines with the information relevant to your course. Each line consists of:
  * {{{unit_id}}}: An integer representing which unit this is.
  * {{{unit_title}}}: The name of the unit.
  * {{{release_date}}}: When this release will be available to students.
  * {{{now_available}}}: Whether or not students should currently be able to access this unit.
