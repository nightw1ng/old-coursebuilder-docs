= Create Home Page =


After successul registration, the student can click on *Home* in the navigation bar of the confirmation page to be taken to the home page for your course. Once registered, any time the student leaves your course and returns to its main URL, this is the page that appears.

You create the home page with these files:
  * {{{views/base.html}}} defines the header and footer areas. See [ModifyTemplate Modify Course Template] for information about this file.
  * {{{views/course.html}}} defines the structure of the content area (the part that contains the schedule).
  * {{{data/unit.csv}}} defines the actual content of the content area. 

You _must_ change these files to be relevant to your course. 

== Structure of home page ==

{{{views/course.html}}} contains the structure of the home page. It consists of a short blurb and a list of units and assessments. For the list, this file contains the structure of how they are laid out. You specify the actual text to display for the units in the list in {{{data/unit.csv}}}.

You must change the blurb to be relevant to your course. 

The general format of the course as defined in this file is 
  * pre-course assessment
  * three units
  * pre-course assessment
  * three units
  * final assessment

If that matches your content, you don't need to make any more changes to {{{views/course.html}}}. 

If you have different assessments, a different number of units, or the ordering is different, you must change this file to reflect that.

== List of units ==

{{{data/unit.csv}}} contains the list of units to appear on the home page. The first line describes the content of the other lines:

  {{{unit_id,unit_title,release_date,now_available}}}

Each line after that contains the information for an individual unit, such as: 
  {{{3,Advanced techniques,available July 12,True}}}

When you edit the file, leave the first line as is. Replace all of the other lines with the information relevant to your course. Each line consists of:
  * {{{unit_id}}}: An integer representing which unit this is.
  * {{{unit_title}}}: The name of the unit.
  * {{{release_date}}}: When this release will be available to students.
  * {{{now_available}}}: Whether or not students should currently be able to access this unit.
