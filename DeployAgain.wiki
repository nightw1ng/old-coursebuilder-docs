#summary How to deploy your course after an initial version has already been deployed.

<h1>Subsequent Deployments to Google App Engine</h1>

<wiki:toc />

This page talks about re-deploying Course Builder to Google App Engine. That is, you have at least deployed once. You may want to re-deploy because you are upgrading Course Builder versions. If you have not deployed to production yet, see [UploadCode Deploy Your App to Google App Engine for the First Time].

== Deploy Course Builder ==
The most straightforward way to deploy Course Builder is from a [http://code.google.com/p/gcb-x-03141590/wiki/FAQ#What%27s_a_%22shell_or_command_prompt%22? shell or command prompt]. From that window:

  {{{cd }}}_*{{{APPPATH}}}*_<br>
  {{{appcfg.py update .}}}<br>

where _*{{{APPPATH}}}*_ is the directory containing your app's code. _Note that the period at the end of the {{{appcfg.py update}}} command is necessary._

For each {{{appcfg.py}}} command, you are asked to supply your credentials. Supply your username and the app-specific password you created in the [#Set_up_an_app-specific_password previous step].

Once the deployment completes and confirms, you (and everyone else on the planet not blocked from Google) can visit {{{http://}}}_*{{{APP_ID}}}*_{{{.appspot.com}}} and verify that your app is indeed available to all.

Here is a video that shows this process, from download to deployment: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtVd1komyGY&list=PLbTy14-ZMIDJGS1XLdYj3Nzrhfd6EDWJC download, installation, and deployment (4:33).]

==== Enable and use Datastore Admin ====
The following steps you only need to do once:

  # From a web  browser, navigate to https://appengine.google.com/.
  # On the *My Applications* page, click on the name of your app. The dashboard for your app appears:<br> <img src="http://wiki.course-builder.googlecode.com/git/images/prod-dashboard.png" /> 
  # In the left navigation, click on *Datastore Admin*. The first time you do this, a screen appears asking if you want to enable datastore administration options:<br> <img src="http://wiki.course-builder.googlecode.com/git/images/datastore-enable.png" /> 
  # Click on *Enable Datastore Admin*.
  # The *Datastore Admin* page for your app appears.

You now can use the Datastore Admin to directly inspect or export data stored by a Course Builder. We advise you not to modify any datastore objects directly.

== Enable Google App Engine Appstats ==
The Appstats library in Google App Engine helps profile your Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) for your implementation of Course Builder. It is a debugging feature and optional. For example, you may want to know if there are any redundant calls to the datastore.  By default Appstats is disabled.

The setting to enable this feature is in {{{app.yaml}}}.  Specifically, it is under {{{env_variables}}}:
{{{
	...
	env_variables:
	  GCB_PRODUCT_VERSION: 'x.x.x'
	  GCB_APPSTATS_ENABLED: false
	...
}}}

To turn on Appstats, set {{{GCB_APPSTATS_ENABLED}}} to {{{true}}}. To learn more about Appstats, see the [https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/appstats Google App Engine documentation].
