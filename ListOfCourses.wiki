|| [http://cb-polsc201.saylor.org/ POLSC201: Introduction to Western Political Thought] || This course will take you on a tour of Western political thought from Ancient Greece to the 19th century. We will focus on the major, canonical political thinkers—from Plato to Marx—in order to develop a critical perspective towards understanding the politics of today. We will examine how these different voices were in dialogue with one another, often grappling with the same set of issues and responding directly to one another’s works, in order to develop a strong foundation in the tradition of Western political thought. || The Saylor Foundation || [mailto:charlie.adair@saylor.org Charlie Adair] || University students ||
|| [http://cb-me102.saylor.org/ ME102: Mechanics I] || Mechanics I is about things: how things move, how things react to forces, and how they sometimes fall apart. We will need to learn to use all the right terms (for example, "statics," "solids," "forces," "moments," "vectors," and "torque"), but ultimately, this course is about objects in the real world and how they behave, move, twist, and turn when subjected to different influences, like wind, or the weight of your hand, or the twisting motion of a wrench. The end goal in this course is to begin to think like an engineer. Put differently, we're going to begin to learn how and why things break so that we can build them better. || The Saylor Foundation || [mailto:charlie.adair@saylor.org Charlie Adair] || University students ||
|| [http://ixml.es iXML] || Introduction to XML: XML, DTD, XML Namespaces, XML Schema, XSLT, XQuery, and XPath. Applications. || University of Alicante || [mailto:sergio.lujan@ua.es Sergio Luján Mora] || University students, Teachers ||
