<h1>Open Source Contributions</h1>

We made Open Source contributions outside of Course Builder, including:

  *  [https://github.com/google/coursebuilder_xblock_module Google App Engine XBlock Runtime] A library that provides an XBlock runtime environment, which uses the Google App Engine datastore. [cbx cbX] uses this library.
   
  *  [https://github.com/google/realtime-help Realtime Help Chat XBlock] The Realtime Help XBlock (together with a notification service) enables students to ask other students for help in realtime. Authors of edX courses can add this XBlock to a course page. When a student is stuck on a problem, he/she can type a question into this XBlock, which will then be broadcast to other students taking the course. The recipients of the broadcast can then join the original studentâ€™s chat room, and help him/her to address the problem.
