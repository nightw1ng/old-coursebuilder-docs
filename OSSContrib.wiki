  *  [https://github.com/google/realtime-help Realtime Help Chat Xblock] In the offline world, students who are working together on a homework assignment can easily ask each other for help if they get stuck. However, in an online course, these students are generally not located in the same place, and they may be taking the course at different times. This makes it harder to replicate the real-time help experience, despite the fact that MOOCs have many more participants. The Realtime Help XBlock (together with a notification service) enables students to ask other students for help in realtime. Authors of edX courses can add this XBlock to a course page. When a student is stuck on a problem, he/she can type a question into this XBlock, which will then be broadcast to other students taking the course. The recipients of the broadcast can then join the original studentâ€™s chat room, and help him/her to address the problem.
