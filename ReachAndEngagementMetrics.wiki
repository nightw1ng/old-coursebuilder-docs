Reach and engagement metrics let you determine how many people you reached with the course and how engaged those people were. Some common questions include:

  * How many students registered? 
  * How many completed each unit and each lesson? 
  * What countries did the students come from? 
  * What were the overall drop-off rates? 
  * When did students tend to drop-off?
