#summary Evaluate how many people you reached and how engaged those people were.

=Reach and Engagement=

Evaluating the reach and engagement of your course lets you determine how many people you reached with the course and how engaged those people were. *Reach* refers to how many people visited your course, while *engagement* can refer to how long each person stayed on each page and how many pages each person visited.

Some common questions on reach and engagement include:

  * How many students registered? 
  * How many completed each unit and each lesson? 
  * What countries did the students come from?
  * How many students are new versus returning students?
  * What are the most popular pages?
  * What were the overall drop-off rates? 
  * When did students tend to drop-off?

For suggestions on data you can use to measure reach and engagement, see [ExampleReachEngagementMetrics Example Reach & Engagement Data].

For an example of how to use student assessments and reach and engagement data to evaluate your course's effectiveness, see [AnalyticsForEdu Combine Assessment and Reach Data].

==Google Analytics==
Google Analytics is our tool for collecting and analyzing reach and engagement data. The [http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/index.html Analytics site] contains a lot of useful information. Start with [http://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1008015&topic=1726909&ctx=topic Get started with Google Analytics.] This step-by-step guide describes how to get an Analytics account to use with your course. 

To collect Analytics data, specify your Google Analytics Tracking ID as the value for the {{{google_analytics_id}}} setting in your [CourseSettings course.yaml] file.
