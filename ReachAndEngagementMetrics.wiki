#summary Evaluate how many people you reached and how engaged those people were.

=Reach and Engagement=

Evaluating the reach and engagement of your course lets you determine how many people you reached with the course and how engaged those people were. Some common questions include:

  * How many students registered? 
  * How many completed each unit and each lesson? 
  * What countries did the students come from? 
  * What were the overall drop-off rates? 
  * When did students tend to drop-off?

For suggestions on data you can use to measure reach and engagement, see [ExampleReachEngagementMetrics Example Reach & Engagement].

For an example of how to use student assessments and reach and engagement data to evaluate your course's effectiveness, see [AnalyticsForEdu Combine Assessment and Reach Data].
