#summary Metrics to gauge how many people you reached and how engaged those people were.

=Reach and Engagement Metrics=

Reach and engagement metrics let you determine how many people you reached with the course and how engaged those people were. Some common questions include:

  * How many students registered? 
  * How many completed each unit and each lesson? 
  * What countries did the students come from? 
  * What were the overall drop-off rates? 
  * When did students tend to drop-off?

For suggestions on metrics you can use to measure reach and engagement, see [ExampleReachEngagementMetrics Example Reach & Engagement Metrics].

== Adding Analytics tracking ==

If you decide to add Analytics tracking to your course, you need to put the following code in {{{views/base.html}}}:

{{{
<script type="text/javascript">
  var gaJsHost = (("https:" == document.location.protocol) ? "https://ssl." : "http://www.");
  document.write(unescape("%3Cscript src='" + gaJsHost + "google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E"));
</script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  try{
    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker("UA-xxxxxx-x");
    pageTracker._trackPageview();
  } catch(err) {}
</script>
}}}


In this code, replace _*{{{UA-xxxxxx-x}}}*_ on the seventh line with the property ID you got when registering with Analytics.
