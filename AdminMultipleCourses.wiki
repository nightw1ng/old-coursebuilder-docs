#summary Explains how to create and run multiple courses.

<h1>Run Multiple Courses</h1>

<wiki:toc />

Course Builder supports multitenancy: you can host as many courses as you like on a single Google App Engine instance. There is nothing special to enable to run multiple courses, merely create new courses as described in [CreateNewCourse Create New Courses].

Each course must have its own unique namespace although it does not need to have unique course titles. Except the course on the [URLMap root URL], these namespaces will also be a part of your URL. For example, a course with namespace {{{foxtrot}}} can be accessed at {{{yourcourseid.appspot.com/foxtrot}}}.

Ensure you set your [Dashboard#Settings custom settings] for each new course you create.
