==Required Code Changes Checklist=

<font color=red><<TODO Create a checklist of the things that anybody MUST do to change the existing code to create their own mooc. The explanations aren't here; this is just a checklist of things that must be done.>>

From Sean:

I've removed all the Google-specific stuff I could find -- so if you do a code-search within the coursebuilder directory for 'FIXME', you should be able to see all the bits which the content creator needs to fix. The affected files are:

  * controllers/utils.py (for the initial email message)
  * views/forum.html (the forum link)
  * views/base.html (lots of stuff)
  * views/base-registration.html (lots of stuff) (I took the liberty of getting rid of the +1 button on this registration page since that bit of code is not very understandable, but I have kept the +1 button that is on the main course page. We can add the former back later if this becomes an issue.)

In addition, note that the content creator will need to change all the activity files, and all the assessment files, and both bulk-uploaded .csv data files. There is an example of a forum link embedded in one of the activities in assets/js/activity-1.2.js.
