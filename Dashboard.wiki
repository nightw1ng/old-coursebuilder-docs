#summary Explains how course authors can get an overview of a particular course.

<h1>Dashboard</h1>

<wiki:toc />

The Dashboard shows a broad range of information about a particular course. Information in the Dashboard includes the course outline, assets, settings, and student statistics. You must be the course author or have similar privileges (for example, teacher’s assistant) to access the Dashboard.

Access the Dashboard from the menu bar. At the very top of every Dashboard page, there are breadcrumbs to aid your navigation. Breadcrumbs are navigational aids that help orient where you are on a site. It shows your current location (at the far right) and a “trail” or path that illustrates the pages you clicked through to arrive where you are now.

==Outline==
This is your default landing page when you enter the Dashboard.  This page shows:

  * *Pages.* Links to your course announcement page and the preview page.
    * _Import_. Import settings and data from another course on the same Google App Engine instance. For example, you can import the example Power Searching course into your newly made course. This button is only available if your course is completely empty.
    * _Add Assessment_. Create new assessments directly online through the assessment editor. See [CreateAssessments#Writing_assessments Writing Assessments] for more information on creating and editing courses.
    * _Add Link_. Add a URL into your course. The URL can be relative to your course URL or in can be an absolute URL.
    * _Add Unit_. Create new units. The newly created units show in the *Course Outline* section.
    * _Add Lesson_. Create new lessons and activities. The newly created lessons show in the *Course Outline* section. The newly created activities show up in the corresponding lesson pages.
    * _Organize__. Change the order of your course. You can change the order in which your students are presented with units, lessons, and assessments. You can change the order of your assessments, units, and the lessons within each unit through the up and down buttons. However, you cannot move lessons from one unit into another unit. For example, lesson 2.1 cannot "jump into" unit 1.
  * *Course Outline.* Outline of the course. It is ordered and structured exactly the way students see it. Each hyperlink goes to the corresponding course page.
  * *Data Files.* Shows the file and pathname of the data file(s) that contains lesson information for the course. If you created courses through the browser, these data files are in the Google App Engine datastore. You can use the [ExportCourseData downloading] feature to download them to localhost. 
  
==Assets==
This page shows all the elements that are used to construct your course.

<img src="http://wiki.course-builder.googlecode.com/git/images/dashboard-assets.png" height=788 width=600 />

 * *Question Bank.* Create questions that you can use both in activities and assessments. 
 * *Question Groups.* Group your questions so you can insert the group into both activities and assessments.
 * *Assessments.* Links to your course assessments.
 * *Activities.* Links to your course activities.
 * *Images & Documents.* Links to the images and documents that you added to the course. To add images and documents, click the *Upload* button. This saves the file in Google App Engine datastore, which may be more expensive to host compared to statically hosting elsewhere.
 * *Cascading Style Sheets.* Pathname to the inherited CSS. You can make changes here, by clicking *Edit*, and they will propagate to all your courses.
 * *!JavaScript Libraries.* Pathname to the inherited !JavaScript libraries. You can make changes here, by clicking *Edit*, and they will propagate to all your courses.
 * *View Templates.* Pathname to the inherited HTML templates. You can make changes here, by clicking *Edit*, and they will propagate to all your courses.

==Settings==
The Settings section shows how your course is customized in the {{{course.yaml}}} file described in [CourseSettings Customize Course Settings]. If you want to know why certain elements are named the way they are, this section is a good place to start.

In the *About the Course* section, you see the location of the {{{course.yaml}}} file from which the customizations are originating.  The Datastore Namespace refers to the particular name assigned to your course in the Google App Engine datastore. This is helpful in those cases when multiple courses are deployed from a single Google App Engine instance.

The *Contents of course.yaml file* section is an exact representation of your {{{course.yaml}}} file. As a course author, you may not have access to this file like the administrator. Seeing the contents of this section can help you understand your course settings and communicate with the administrator viewing the same file. To edit {{{course.yaml}}} directly, click the *Edit* or *Advanced Edit* button. The *Advanced Edit* shows a text box with your {{{course.yaml}}} settings. If you edit here, you must be careful with YAML spacing or you will get an error. The *Edit* button is a form based approach to editing your {{{course.yaml}}} settings.

You do not need to mind the YAML spacing and some keys are conveniently represented as checkboxes you can check or uncheck.

When you create a [CreateNewCourse new course], this section will be mostly empty except for some default text and the new course name. New courses are by default private, which means students cannot view them. To make your course public, change the {{{now_available:}}} assignment to {{{True}}}. That is, in the *Advanced Edit* view the line should look like:

{{{now_available: True}}}

while in the *Edit* view the *Make Course Available* checkbox should be checked.

==Analytics==
This page shows statistics regarding the students, including enrollment, assessments, progress, and peer review analytics.  In the Assessment section, you can view the number of students who completed a particular assessment and the average score of all those who have done so. In the Student Progress Statistics section, view the number of students who have completed particular sections. Remember that if you want to see progress on activities, you must turn on the activity recording setting in *Admin > Settings*. In the Peer Review section, you can see bar charts showing the number of assignments with a particular number of reviews.

The *Update Statistics* button will refresh all statistics on the page. Note that the time it takes to update depends on the number of students you have.

==Search==
Before you can retrieve results from a search through the Search box, you must index your course. Choose the appropriate option to index your course. When you first index a new course, it does not matter which indexing method you select.

Search will not cover results that are in sections marked "Private". It will also search over user created captions but not over automatically created captions.

==Peer Review==
Peer review is a way for students to grade each other's finished work. You would normally go into this section to see the contents of the peer review assignment and when students have issues about their peer review work. See [PeerReview Peer Review] for detailed information.

  * *Select Assignment.* Here you pick a particular peer review assignment and a particular student. The student is identified by exact email. That is, the email address is case sensitive. If a peer review assignment was submitted by the student and particular peer review assignment you selected, information in the *Assignment* area show.
  * *Assignment.* This section will show the actual contents of the peer review assignment that was submitted by the selected student and any review that was done by a peer. As a course author, you can delete a particluar review with the "Remove This Review" button. You can also assign a specific person to be the reviewer of a particular stuent's work through the "Add New Reviewer" button. For example, you might want to add a Teacher's Assistant or yourself to review the work.
