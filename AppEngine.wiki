      * This file includes the coursebuilder app and all files that will replicate the PS course, including javascript activities and assessments
    # Deploy an AppEngine instance
      * Go to https://appengine.google.com/domain/apps and click “Create Application”
      * Generate a unique URL (we may want to give them guidance, like first part of your email-mooc.appspot.com)
      * Make sure you have Python 2.7 installed on your computer
      * Download the Python AppEngine SDK from https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/ 
        * Download the doc server
        * Download the appcfg.py file	
      * Launch the doc server
      * Launch the appcfg.py file and point it to the unzipped root directory
      * Deploy the application to AppEngine
    # Download the spreadsheet we give you as a csv
      * Upload the csv to the AppEngine data store (both to the local version and deployed version)
