Steps for creating a Coursebuilder app engine application
  # Download the coursebuilder .zip file from our site
    * Unzip it and note the root directory
    * This file includes the coursebuilder app and all files that will replicate the PS course, including javascript activities and assessments
    * Change the "Application" in the app.yaml file from "markf-searchedu" to your own app ID
  # Create an AppEngine instance
    * Go to https://appengine.google.com/ and click “Create Application”
    * Generate a unique URL (we may want to give them guidance, like first part of your email-mooc.appspot.com)
    * Make sure you have Python 2.7 installed on your computer
    * Download the Python AppEngine SDK from https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/ 
      * This file includes both the doc server and the appcfg.py file
      * Install the GoogleAppEngine application (on a Mac, drag it to the Applications folder)
    * Open the AppEngine Launcher
      * File → Add Existing Application
      * Choose the root directory for the unzipped Coursebuilder file from step 1.
    * Click run to launch the doc server
      * If you encounter an error in the log files that says you are not running Python 2.7,  or warnings about using a runtime that is older than the production runtime, then go to the GoogleAppEngineLauncher-->Preferences and manually specify the Python 2.7 path. 
      * Determine the path by opening a terminal window and typing [which python]. Copy and paste the path (mine looked like this: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python) 
  # In the AppEngine Launcher, click Deploy
  # Download the spreadsheet we give you as a csv
    * Upload the csv to the AppEngine data store (both to the local version and deployed version)
