== Naming your app ==

What does it mean for an app to run in production? In production, your app lives in Google datacenters. Google runs the production server. 

By default, your app automatically gets a domain name so that it can be reached from almost anywhere on the internet. That domain is of the form _{{{APP_ID}}}_{{{.appspot.com}}} where _{{{APP_ID}}}_ is the app ID you chose. App ID names can only be used once and can never be returned to the pool of available names. Whether your app is running, not running, or deleted, once a name has been chosen, it can no longer be used by any other app. 

More details on creating an app can be found in the [https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/uploading official docs].
