#summary How to upload your course code to Google production servers.

<h1>(When you're ready) Upload your app to Google</h1>

*Do not do this step* until you are ready for your code to go live in production; that is, until you are ready for your audience to see your course.

If you want to see what your app looks like in production, you can upload it to Google. When traffic comes to your app, App Engine servers start up an instance running your app and enable access to it from its default URL of _{{{APP_ID}}}_{{{.appspot.com}}} to handle requests. To get your app to Google, there are two main options: use the Launcher or the command-line tool. (Be sure to have registered your app as described in [GetCode Get the Source Code], otherwise you won't be able to upload your app.)

Using the Launcher is fairly straightforward: click on the *Deploy* button and enter your credentials. Using the command-line is almost as easy.  

  {{{cd }}}_*{{{APPPATH}}}*_<br>
  {{{appcfg.py update .}}}

where _*{{{APPPATH}}}*_ is the directory/folder containing your app.

It can take up to a minute to upload your app; generally it's less than 30 seconds but usually not more than a minute. Once the upload complete and confirm, you (and everyone else on the planet not blocked from Google) can visit {{{http://}}}_*{{{APP_ID}}}*_{{{.appspot.com}}} (with your_*{{{APP_ID}}}*_) and verify that your app is indeed available to all.

According to Sean, production doesn't have clear_datastore, so if you want to change the data store (ie, lesson.csv and unit.csv) after loading an app to production, it's tricky.

Apparently, the answer is:

  it would be necessary to go to the appengine.google.com console and delete the entries one page at a time, which is really tedious (I've had to do that before).

  Are we worried about people running into this obstacle? We may not need to document it, but I imagine that it may come up on the forums. Perhaps in that case we could point them to [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1062540/how-to-delete-all-datastore-in-google-app-engine this].
