Throughout your course, you may want to send email to all of your registered students. (See [Announcements#Reminder_announcements,_typically_in_email Announcements and Optional Matierial] for suggested emails). To do so, you need an email alias that includes those registered students. Course Builder does not provide a way to automatically enroll students in an email list.

Instead, you have several options:

  * If you already have a way to manage a large email alias, use that mechanism. To get a list of registered students,  see [ExportingCourseData Export Course Data].

  * If your course has fewer than 100 students, you can send mail from your Course Builder App Engine application. See the official [https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/mail/sendingmail App Engine documentation].

  * In other situations, you can use Google Groups to create an announcement email alias. Include a subscription link to your group on the page you display when a student successfully [CreateRegistration registers].

This page discusses how to create an announcement alias using Google Groups.

<font color=red><<TODO figure this out >></font> For example, if your email alias is FOO, then include something like the following in {{{views/confirmation.html}}}:

  {{{<p class="top_content">Thank you for registering. To receive announcements }}}
  {{{about this course, register for the announcements only email list at}}}
  {{{SOMETHING}}}

To create an announcements only Google Groups list, follow the instructions at [http://support.google.com/groups/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2464926 Create a group]. To create a group that only lets owners or managers post (that is, one that you use for announcements but not for interacting with your students), follow these extra instructions:

  * On the *Create Group* screen, set the following:
    * Set *Group type* to *Email list*.
    * Under *Basic permissions*, 
      * Set *View topics* to *Anyone*.
      * Set *Post* to *Owners of the group*.
      * Set *Join the group* to *Anyone*.

  * Once you finish creating your group, you see a Congratulations screen. From that screen, choose *Customize your group's settings*.

    * In the left navigation, expand *Settings*.
      * In the left navigation, choose *Email options*.
        * (Optional) Add a subject prefix, so students can easily identify messages sent from this group.
        * (Optional) In *Email footer*, choose *Display how to unsubscribe from this group by email.*
        * In *Post replies*, choose *To the owners of the group*. This restricts members of the alias from sending email to anybody other than the group owners.
        * Save these settings.
      * In the left navigation, choose *Moderation*.
        * In *Moderate messages*, choose *Moderate all messages to the group.*
        * Save these settings.
      * In the left navigation, choose *New members*.
        * In *New member permissions*, turn off *New members can post*.
        * Save these settings.

    * In the left navigation, expand *Permissions*.
      * In the left navigation, choose *Access permissions*.
        * Set *Contact the Owner of a Group* to *Owners for the group*, to restrict posting to the owners.
        * Save these settings.

    * In the left navigation, expand *Members*.
      * In the left navigation, choose *All members*. You should be the only listed member.
      * Click on the row representing you.
      * On the new page, under *Posting permission*, choose *Override: member is allowed to post*.
      * Save these settings.

You (and only you) can now post messages to your new group, either from the Google Groups interface or by sending email to _*{{{GROUPNAME}}}*_{{{@googlegroups.com}}}.
