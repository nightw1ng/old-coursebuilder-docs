Throughout your course, you may want to send email to all of your registered students. To do so, you need an email alias that includes those registered students.

To get a list of registered students, <font color=red><<TODO use the script someone's going to write.>></font>

If you already have a way to manage a large email alias, use that mechanism. If you do not, you can use Google Groups to create an announcement email alias. If you have a small list of students, you can add them automatically to your list. For a larger course, however, with Google Groups your best option is to include a subscription link on the page you display when a student successfully [CreateRegistration registers].

<font color=red><<TODO figure this out >></font> For example, if your email alias is FOO, then include something like the following in {{{views/confirmation.html}}}:

  {{{<p class="top_content">Thank you for registering. To receive announcements }}}
  {{{about this course, register for the announcements only email list at}}}
  {{{SOMETHING}}}

To create an announcements only Google Groups list, follow the instructions at [http://support.google.com/groups/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2464926 Create a group]. To create a group that only lets owners or managers post (that is, one that you use for announcements but not for interacting with your students), follow these extra instructions:

  * On the *Create Group* screen, set the following:
    * Set *Group type* to *Email list*.
    * Under "Basic permissions", 
      * Set *View topics* to *All members of the group*.
      * Set *Post* to *Managers of the  group*. (This includes owners of the group.)
      * Set *Join the group* to *Anyone*.

  * Once you finish creating your group, you see a Congratulations screen. From that screen, choose *Customize your group's settings*. From that screen:

    * In the left navigation, expand *Information*.
      * Choose *General information*. (It may already be chosen.)
      * In *Posting options*, turn off *Allow posting  by email*.
      * Save these settings.

    * In the left navigation, expand *Settings*.
      * Choose *Email options*.
      * (Optional) Add a subject prefix, so students can easily identify messages sent from this group.
      * (Optional) In *Email footer*, choose *Display how to unsubscribe from this group by email.*
      * In *Post replies*, choose *To the managers of the group*. This restricts members of the alias from sending email to anybody other than the group managers.
      * Save these settings.
      * Choose *Moderation*.
        * In *Moderate messages*, choose *Moderate all messages to the group.*
        * Save these settings.
      * Choose *New members*.
        * In *New member permissions*, turn off *New members can post*.
        * Save these settings.

    * In the left navigation, expand *Permissions*.
      * Choose *Basic permissions*.
        * Set *Post* to *Managers of the group, Onwers for the group*, to restrict posting to the managers and owners.
        * Save these settings.
      * Choose *Access permissions*.
        * Set *Contact the Owner of a Group* to *Managers of the group, Onwers for the group*, to restrict posting to the managers and owners.
        * Save these settings.
