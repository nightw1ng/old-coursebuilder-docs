Every page displayed for your course starts from either the {{{base_registration.html}}} template (for unenrolled people) or {{{base.html}}} template (for enrolled people). Those templates define the overall HTML structure of a page. The other views, such as {{{activity.html}}}, fill in more structure for a specific type of page. Finally, files outside of views may fill in the content for a particular page, such as {{{activity-1.1.js}}}.  <br>You _must_ change a few of these files.
