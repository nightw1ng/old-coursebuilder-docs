<h1>Explore the Sample Code</h1>

The following table briefly describes the directory structure for the sample code provided with Course Builder. Much of this code you will leave as is. The last column of the table notes which files you must change to produce your own application.

|| *Pathname* || *Filename* || *Description* || *Needs changing?* || 
|| || {{{COPYING}}} || || ||
|| || {{{README}}} || || ||
|| || {{{VERSION}}} || Course Builder release number. || No ||

|| || {{{appengine_config.py}}} || || || 
|| {{{assets/}}} || || || || 
|| {{{assets/css/}}} || || || || 
|| {{{assets/css/}}}  || {{{main.css}}} || CSS file that specifies the look of the HTML pages associated with your course. || Possible || 
|| {{{assets/img/}}} || || || || 
|| {{{assets/img/}}} || _{{{[Image*.png files]}}}_ || Images that appear throughout your course. Replace these files with any images you need for your material.|| Required || 
|| {{{assets/img/}}} || {{{banner1.png}}} || The image to appear on your course home page.|| Required ||
|| {{{assets/img/}}} || {{{favicon.ico}}} || A favicon is a small image that appears next to your application in the browser address bar and in bookmarks. You may want to change this to an icon for your course. || Likely ||

|| {{{assets/js/}}} || || || || 
|| {{{assets/js/}}} || _{{{[activity-N.M.js]}}}_ || These are sample files. You must replace all of them. These files define the activities associated with your lessons. See [CreateActivities Create Activities]. || Required || 
|| {{{assets/js/}}}  || {{{activity-generic}}}.js || The !JavaScript code that defines the logic for running activities and assessments. You define the content of the activities and assessments in the _{{{[activity-N.M.js]}}}_ and _{{{[assessment-SUFFIX.js]}}}_ files. || || 
|| {{{assets/js/}}}  || _{{{[assessment-SUFFIX.js]}}}_ || These are sample files. You must replace all of them. These files define the assessments associated with your lessons. See [CreateAssessments Create Assessments]. || Required || 
|| {{{assets/js/}}} || {{{jquery-1.7.2.min.js}}} || || || 
|| || {{{bulkloader.yaml}}} || Defines the mapping between entities stored in the Google App Engine datastore (including the data in {{{data/lesson.csv}}} and {{{data/unit.csv}}}) and how those entities are referred to in code. If you have a large number of students and download the student data, you may need to modify this file. See [ExportCourseData Export Course Data]. || Possible || 
|| {{{controllers}}} || || ||  ||
|| {{{controllers/}}} || {{{__init__.py}}} ||  || || 
|| {{{controllers/}}} || {{{assessments.py}}} || Classes and methods to manage assessments, including scoring. Optionally, you can change how to score assessments.

|| {{{controllers/}}} || {{{servings.py}}} ||  || || 
|| {{{controllers/}}} || {{{sites.py}}} ||  || || 
|| {{{controllers/}}} || {{{utils.py}}} || Utility functions. Optionally, you can change the maximum student enrollment allowed; that value defaults to 250,000. At present, the only difference between a student who enrolls before the limit and one who enrolls after the limit is the page they see. That page implies to the latter that they do not have access to the course. They do. If you want to really enforce enrollment limits, you must write special Python code.  || Possible ||
|| {{{data/}}} || || ||  ||
|| {{{data/}}} || _{{{[bulkloader-log-SUFFIX]}}}_ || These files appear when you upload data (such as CSV files) to the course.  || || 
|| {{{data/}}} || _{{{[bulkloader-progress-SUFFIX]}}}_ || These files appear when you upload data to the course. || ||

|| {{{views}}} || || These HTML files comprise templates that define what the pages of your course look like to students.<br>Course Builder uses [http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/ Jinja2 templating]. The templates work together hierarchically. Every page displayed for your course starts from either the {{{base_registration.html}}} template (for unenrolled people) or {{{base.html}}} template (for enrolled people). Those templates define the overall HTML structure of a page. The other views, such as {{{activity.html}}}, fill in more structure for a specific type of page. Finally, files outside of views may fill in the content for a particular page, such as {{{activity-1.1.js}}}.  <br>You _must_ change a few of these files. You _can_ change any of them. || ||
