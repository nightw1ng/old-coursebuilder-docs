<h1>Explore the Sample Code</h1>

The following briefly describes the directory structure for the source code files provided with Course Builder. Much of this code you will leave as is and some of it needs to change for your specific course.

==Files specific to your course.===
You should modify the following files (except files in {{{lib}}}) to implement your course:
  * {{{assets}}} - various files that make up the content of your course
    * {{{css}}} - cascading style sheet (CSS) files
    * {{{img}}} - images
    * {{{js}}} - activity and assessment !JavaScript files
    * {{{lib}}} - Course Builder and third party front-end libraries
    * you can add here additional sub-folders for your other content (PDF, ...)
  * {{{data}}} - CSV data files that define sequence of units and lessons of the course
  * {{{course.yaml}}} - main course configuration file
  * {{{course_template.yaml}}} - course specific settings

==Files common to all courses.==
You should avoid modifying these files to simplify migration to future versions of Course Builder:
  * {{{controllers}}} - various web request handlers
  * {{{models}}} - common infrastructure classes and database entities
  * {{{modules}}} - various extension modules
    * {{{admin}}} - administrator console
    * {{{announcements}}} - announcements display and editor
    * {{{dashboard}}} - course author dashboard
    * {{{i18n}}} - translation files for supporting user interface in multiple languages
    * {{{oeditor}}} - generic AJAX object editor used by other modules
  * {{{lib}}} - third party open-source libraries not developed by Google; it's your responsibility to review and accept licensing terms for each library
  * {{{tests}}} - all unit and functional tests
  * {{{tools}}} - course structure and activity/assessment verification tools; data export tools
  * {{{views}}} - HTML page templates for various course pages
