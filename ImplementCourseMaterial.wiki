This section is about creating your course and modifying Course Builder to make it appropriate for you and your organization. These pages discuss changes you can make to have different course material but essentially the same course layout and the same types of questions and interactions with your students. You are also able to serve many different courses on a single Google App Engine instance.

  <b>Note for PC users:</b> Do *not* use Notepad to edit Course Builder files. If you do, every Course Builder file appears to be one long line. Please use another text editor, such as !WordPad or Notepad++.
