==Release notes for i18n language pack==
  * *Internationalization.* Course Builder now supports 57 languages. [http://code.google.com/p/course-builder/downloads/list Download] the language pack and integrate it with your installation of Course Builder. See [I18n Internationalization].
  
==Release notes for version 1.2.1==
  * *CSV and international characters.* There was a bug that prevented you from uploading CSV files that contained international characters such as accents. This update fixes the issue.
  
  * *course.yaml and international characters.* There was a bug that disabled the *Settings* section in the Dashboard when [CourseSettings course.yaml] contained international characters such as accents. This update fixes the issue.

  
==Release notes for version 1.2.0==
  * *Accessibility.* A variety of accessibility features were added. See [Accessibility Accessibility].
  
  * *Administrator Page.* A new page was added for administrators who manage Google App Engine for Course Builder. See [AdminPage Administrator Page].
  
  * *Announcements.* You can now create and edit announcements directly in the *Announcements* tab.  Furthermore, you can save announcements as drafts and publish them later. See [UpdateAnnouncementsTab Update Announcements Tab].
  
  * *Bulk uploading.* You no longer have to manually upload the unit and lesson CSV files with the bulkuploader. The uploading of these files is now done automatically.
  
  * *course.yaml file.* The {{{course.yaml}}} file is a new file where you make course customizations. You no longer have to edit each individual template file in the {{{/views}}} directory. See [CourseSettings Customize Course Settings].
  
  * *Dashboard.* A new dashboard was added for course authors to see a broad range of information about their course in one place. See [Dashboard Dashboard].
  
  * *Event Recording.* Course Builder now allows recording of all assessment and activity interactions attempted by students. This feature is off by default and can be enabled in Admin > Settings.
  
  * *Internationalization.* An Internationalization framework was added so you can translate the student viewable text in a custom language. New translations in Spanish and Russian were also added. See [I18n Internationalization].
        
  * *Third Party Libraries.* Course Builder now uses several open source third party libraries. The libraries are located in the {{{/lib}}} directory.
  
  * *Yahoo Libraries.* The Administrator and Dashboard interfaces use Yahoo's open-source !JavaScript and CSS libraries (YUI) from http://yuilibrary.com/. Course Builder will make direct web requests to http://yui.yahooapis.com/ to obtain these files. If this is not acceptable, the Course Builder administrator can make a local copy of the YUI libraries and change the HTML templates to point to these local files. The Course Builder student-facing interface does not use YUI.
  
  * *Security.* Cross-site request forgery, also known as XSRF or CSRF, is a malicious attack that tries to exploit the relationship between a website and a userâ€™s browser. Course Builder implements protection against XSRF using transient user-action specific tokens for all state-modifying HTTP operations supported by the product. Note that full in-depth security review has not yet been conducted. You should conduct independent security testing and take additional steps to secure your production site. If you find an issue, please report it immediately to the development team for assessment and resolution.

==Release notes for version 1.1.1==

  * *Windows platform support.* Course Builder version 1.1.0 contained a bug specific to running a development server on Windows platforms. This update fixes the issue.


==Release notes for version 1.1.0==

  * *New tabs.* Course Builder 1.0 contained two tabs: Course and Forum. CB 1.1 adds two new tabs: Announcements and My Profile.
    * *Announcements tab.* The new Announcements tab gives you a place that you can put course announcements, without having to create a separate forum. The content of the announcements tab is in {{{views/announcements.html}}}. See [Announcements Announcements and Optional Material].
    * *My Profile tab.* The new My Profile tab displays basic student information, such as their name and scores on various assessments. It also provides a place for the student to un-enroll from the course or to change their name. See [ModifyProfile Modify My Profile Tab].

  * *Arbitrary number of assessments.* Course Builder 1.0 supported exactly three assessments per course: a pre-course assessment, a mid-term, and a final. In Course Builder 1.1, you can create any number of assessments for each course, each with its own scoring algorithm. See [CreateAssessments Create Assessments].

  * *Support for multiple courses.* In Course Builder 1.0, you could only host one course per Google App Engine application instance. That is, in the GAE Launcher, you needed a separate application for each course and running each course started its own copy of the GAE binary. Two courses could not share any of the same code. CB 1.1 allows you to host multiple courses simultaneously. See [RunMultipleCourses Run Multiple Courses].

  * *List of existing courses.* This documentation now includes a [ListOfCourses list of courses] people have created with Course Builder. If you have created a course and wanted it listed, fill out the form on that page.

  * *Course syllabus before registration.* In Course Builder 1.0, students had to register for a course before they could see the syllabus of the course. Course Builder 1.1 removes this restriction. See [CreateRegistration Create Registration]. 

  * *Page caching.* Course Builder 1.1 [UploadCode#Clear_cached_pages caches pages] displayed to students during production (but not during development). This should reduce the latency perceived by students and can also reduce [AppEngine#Important:_Quotas_and_billing Google App Engine costs]. 

  * *Changes to assessment data.*  Course Builder 1.1 changes how it stores information about student assessments. See [ExportCourseData Export Course Data].

  * *Testing.* Course Builder 1.1 includes a set of functional tests in the new {{{tests}}} directory. If you make significant changes to Course Builder's source code, consider running (and possibly changing) these tests. See [AppEngine#Run_Course_Builder_tests Run Course Builder tests].

==Release notes for version 1.0==

  * *First public release.* Course Builder is our experimental first step in the world of online education.
