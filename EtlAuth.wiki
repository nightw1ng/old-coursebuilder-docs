#summary Authenticating with ETL

= Authenticating with ETL =

To use the ETL tool, you will need to provide OAuth2 credentials. There are many ways to do this, described in the [https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials Application Default Credentials documentation]. We recommend installing the [https://cloud.google.com/sdk/ Google Cloud SDK] and authenticating with the command

{{{
gcloud auth login
}}}

Once this is done, ETL will use your OAuth2 credentials automatically.

You can also set up credentials using the [https://console.developers.google.com Google Developer Console] if you do not want to install the Google Cloud SDK. Refer to the [https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials Application Default Credentials documentation] for more information.

== I used to sign in with username and password. Can I still do that? ==

Sadly, no. Versions of ETL from Course Builder 1.9 and earlier used [https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/AuthForInstalledApps ClientLogin] for authentication, which supported direct authentication to ETL with username and password. !ClientLogin is now [http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2012/04/changes-to-deprecation-policies-and-api.html deprecated]. Consequently, modern versions of ETL use OAuth2 for authentication, and you must provide credential as above.
