#summary Mechanics of creating a lesson.

<h1>Create Lessons</h1>

<wiki:toc />

When students click on a unit from the home page, they go to the page for the first lesson of the unit they chose. From there, they can go to any other lesson or activity in that unit:

This page talks about the mechanics of creating a lesson page and its content. For information on what to put in your lesson, see [TwoDevelop Develop the Content without Technology].

== What happens on a lesson page ==

A lesson page is where you teach your prepared material. Typically, each lesson consists of a short video and text version of the content. You embed the video in the lesson page, hosting the video on !YouTube. (See [WorkWithVideo Working with video].) You put the text version in a file at some other URL; for Power Searching, we hosted the text versions as [http://support.google.com/docs/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=49008 Google Docs]. 

Students can watch the video as many times as they like. If they click on *Text version*, a separate browser window appears with that content.

Everything else on the page is context and navigation.

== Page layout ==
This page consists of four areas:
  * The *header* contains 
    * Course icon and name of your course.
    * Horizontal navigation bar, with two tabs on the left (Course and Forum) and an area with the person's address and a Logout link.
    * A breadcrumb indicating where in the course hierarchy this page exists, such as<br>{{{Course > Unit 1 > Lesson 1}}}.
    * The name and number of the unit.
  * A *vertical navigation bar*, consisting of a list of all lessons in the current unit.
  * The *content area* contains:
    * The name of this lesson.
    * A button to access a text version of the lesson.
    * A list of the lesson objectives.
    * The lesson video.
	* Activities, if any.
    * *Back* and *Next* buttons to navigate through the unit. (The first lesson of a unit does not include the *Back* button.)
  * The *footer* contains the same two links as for the registration pages. 


== Create lessons ==
When you create lessons from the browser, the data gets stored in Google App Engine's datastore. You can use the [ExportCourseData download] feature to download it to your local machine.

To create a lesson from your browser, go to *Dashboard > Outline* and click the *Add Lesson* button from the *Pages* section. Fill out the forms on the page and click *Save*. You have the option of creating the lesson but keeping it private (not viewable to students).

You edit lessons that already exist in this page as well. Change any details you would like and click *Save*.

In the *Objectives* textbox, you create the content for your lesson. For example, you can add an image, !YouTube video, Google Doc, or Google Spreadsheet. You can even add a link to your Group forum as well as an activity. To facilitate the addition of these items, click the *Rich Text* button.

Under *Insert Item* in the toolbar, you see three buttons where you can:

  * Add a HTML link
  * Add an image
  * Add various components, like !YouTube videos, your Group forum, and Google Docs. You can also add a component that allows your students to upload text files ({{{Student Text File Upload}}}). The maximum size for uploaded files is 1MB. 
    * After you add a component, a placeholder icon shows. When you save and go to the lesson, the component itself shows.
  
You can add multiple components or mix and match multiple images with multiple components. Here is a video that shows how to add components: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpQqNkRdcck Add course components (4:48)]
