<font color=red><<TODO to be written>>

When students click on a unit from the home page, they go to the page for the first lesson of the unit they chose. From there, they can go to any other lesson or activity in that unit:

https://www.corp.google.com/~vpg/no_crawl/cb/lesson.png


This page consists of four areas:
  * The *header* contains 
    * Course icon and name of your course.
    * Horizontal navigation bar, with two tabs on the left (Course and Forum) and an area with the person's address and a Logout link.
    * A breadcrumb indicating where in the course hierarchy this page exists, such as<br>{{{Course > Unit 1 > Lesson 1}}}.
    * The name and number of the unit.
  * A *vertical navigation bar*, consisting of a list of all lessons and activities in the current unit.
  * The *content area* is more complex than for previous pages. It contains:
    * The name of this lesson.
    * A button to access a text version of the lesson.
    * A list of the lesson objectives.
    * The lesson video.
    * *Back* and *Next* buttons to navigate through the unit. (The first lesson of a unit does not include the *Back* button.)
  * The *footer* contains the same two links as for the registration pages. 

The app uses three files to render this page:
  * {{{views/base.html}}} defines the first two parts of the header and defines the footer.
  * {{{views/unit.html}}} defines the second two lines of the header, the vertical navigation, and the content area.
  * {{{data/lesson.csv}}} contains the content of the content area for all lessons in your course.


== More stuff to write == 

Mention putting hooks into the forum: for students sharing answers, for instructors posting advanced or background material

    * Be clear to the students what the course flow will be (perhaps talk about it in the very first video)
   * Advanced and background material as forum posts or as separate mini-courses. (We haven't done the latter.) Alternatively, use G+ or blog posts to introduce material you won't test on.
  * Do you care about accessibility? Consider video captioning. Consider live captioning for HOAs. Think about the effect of using a screen reader for accessing text and assessments.
  * Consistency of lessons.  Make the first few minutes of every lesson deeply compelling so they'll want to stay.


==Video==
  * Takes a long time to do well
  * Have a clear edit request process with deadlines for feedback and edits.
  * Maintain up-to-date documentation of edits requested and completed, including the state of the edits: edited, exported, compressed, uploaded, and other relevant information (perhaps work with the team to consolidate this documentation).
  * Create text version of all lessons prior to filming
  * Film the videos once the objectives, assessments, and activities have been solidified.
  * Send out raw versions of the videos for review (by legal and ID/SME for example) before beginning the editing process.
  * Collect as many edit requests as possible before beginning the editing process, and only complete the production cycle (through uploading) when absolutely necessary.
  * Remember that edits may change the captions. Look into having someone clean up the captions.
  * Record separate feeds of the presenter and computer material.
  * Run through live demos quickly prior to recording
  * Have as many content creators present during filming as possible (in order to catch any issues so they can be reshot on the spot).
  * Have someone committed to going through the final videos and uploads to double-check everything.
  * Allow ample time for captioning and edits of videos
