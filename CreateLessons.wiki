#summary Mechanics of creating a lesson.

<h1>Create Lessons</h1>

<wiki:toc />

When students click on a unit from the home page, they go to the page for the first lesson of the unit they chose. From there, they can go to any other lesson or activity in that unit:

This page talks about the mechanics of creating a lesson page and its content. For information on what to put in your lesson, see [TwoDevelop Develop the Content without the Technology].

== What happens on a lesson page ==

A lesson page is where you teach your prepared material. Typically, each lesson consists of a short video and text version of the content. You embed the video in the lesson page, hosting the video on !YouTube. (See [#Working_with_video Working with video].) You put the text version in a file at some other URL; for Power Searching, we hosted the text versions as [http://support.google.com/docs/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=49008 Google Docs]. 

Students can watch the video as many times as they like. If they click on *Text version*, a separate browser window appears with that content.

Everything else on the page is context and navigation.

== Page layout ==

This page consists of four areas:
  * The *header* contains 
    * Course icon and name of your course.
    * Horizontal navigation bar, with two tabs on the left (Course and Forum) and an area with the person's address and a Logout link.
    * A breadcrumb indicating where in the course hierarchy this page exists, such as<br>{{{Course > Unit 1 > Lesson 1}}}.
    * The name and number of the unit.
  * A *vertical navigation bar*, consisting of a list of all lessons and activities in the current unit.
  * The *content area* contains:
    * The name of this lesson.
    * A button to access a text version of the lesson.
    * A list of the lesson objectives.
    * The lesson video.
    * *Back* and *Next* buttons to navigate through the unit. (The first lesson of a unit does not include the *Back* button.)
  * The *footer* contains the same two links as for the registration pages. 

The app uses three files to render this page:
  * {{{views/base.html}}} defines the first two parts of the header and defines the footer; it is the same file as for activities.  See [ModifyTemplate Modify Course Template] for information about this file.
  * {{{views/unit.html}}} defines the second two lines of the header, the vertical navigation, and the content area. Note that these are the same parts {{{views/activity.html}}} defines for activities. You probably want to be consistent in these files.
  * {{{data/lesson.csv}}} contains the content of the content area for all lessons in your course.

=== Secondary header and vertical navigation ===

The second two lines of the header, the vertical navigation, and the content area are defined in {{{views/unit.html}}}. If you like the look of those areas, there's nothing for you to change in {{{views/unit.html}}}. 

=== Lesson content ===

{{{data/lesson.csv}}} contains information about each lesson, such as the video's URL and the lesson's title. The first line describes the content of the other lines:
  {{{unit_id,unit_title,lesson_id,lesson_title,lesson_activity,lesson_activity_name,lesson_notes,lesson_video_id,lesson_objectives}}}

Each line after that contains the information for an individual lesson, such as: 

  {{{3,Advanced techniques,1,Web organization,Yes,Lesson 3.1 Activity,https://docs.google.com/SOMETHING,DndOoEVCWfI,"- Describe how operators filter results.}}}<br>
  {{{- Use the site: operator at the top-level domain and website levels.}}}<br>
  {{{- Use a word you expect to appear on the target page to refine results.}}}<br>
  {{{- Use the site: operator within images and news results."}}}

When you edit the file, leave the first line as is. Replace all of the other lines with the information relevant to your course. Each line consists of:

  # {{{unit_id:}}} An integer indicating which unit this lesson is part of.  (You must number units consecutively starting with 1.)
  # {{{unit_title:}}} The name of the unit.
  # {{{lesson_id:}}} An integer indicating which lesson this is.  (You must number lessons in each unit consecutively starting with 1.)
  # {{{lesson_title:}}} The name of the lesson.
  # {{{lesson_activity:}}} Set this value to {{{Yes}}} if there is an associated activity. Leave it blank if there is not.
  # {{{lesson_activity_name:}}} The name of the associated activity, to appear as the title of the activity page.
  # {{{lesson_notes:}}} URL of the text version of the lesson.
  # {{{lesson_video_id:}}} The id of the !YouTube video associated with the lesson. For example, if the URL of the video is [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DndOoEVCWfI], then the id is {{{DndOoEVCWfI}}}.
  # {{{lesson_objectives:}}} A string containing lesson objectives, to appear after the title of the lesson.

The following image shows where this information appears on the screen:

=== Testing changes ===

Changes you make to any file in the {{{views}}} directory appear automatically in your running development server.

That is, after you make a change to one of these files, simply load (or reload) a page that uses that view and the change appears. 

On the other hand, if you change the content of the {{{data/lesson.csv}}} file, you must load the changed data into your development server as described in [AppEngine#Modify_your_app_and_see_the_effects Modify your app and see the effects].

== Working with Video ==

It is outside the scope of this documentation to tell you how to create video. We do have a few general tips that may make your life easier:

  * *In general*
    * Just be warned that creating a video takes a long time to do well. Leave ample time in your schedule for initial filming, editing, and any necessary refilming and reediting.

  * *Prior to filming*
    * Solidify the course objectives, assessments, and activities prior to filming.
    * Create the text version of all lessons prior to filming.
    * Basically, wait to film until everything else is done. Fixing video problems takes much longer than fixing textual problems.

  * *During filming*
    * Run through live demos quickly prior to recording.
    * Record separate feeds of the presenter and any computer material.
    * Have as many content creators present during filming as possible (in order to catch any issues so they can be reshot on the spot).

  * *Captioning*
    * Consider adding captions to your videos to help the hearing impaired and to help students who are not natives speakers of the language used in your videos.
    * Remember that edits may change the captions. Look into having someone clean up the captions.

  * *Editing*
    * Have a clear edit request process with deadlines for feedback and edits.
    * Maintain up-to-date documentation of edits requested and completed, including the state of the edits: edited, exported, compressed, uploaded, and other relevant information.
    * Collect as many edit requests as possible before beginning the editing process, and only complete the production cycle (through uploading) when absolutely necessary.
    * Have someone committed to going through the final videos and uploads to double check everything.

Once you have created your videos, you need to post them to the internet to make them available to students. If you decide to post your videos on !YouTube, you may be interested in the following information:
