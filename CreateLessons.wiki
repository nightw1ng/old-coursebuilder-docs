#summary Mechanics of creating a lesson and activities.

<h1>Create Lessons and Activities</h1>

<wiki:toc />

When students click on a unit from the home page, they go to the page for the first lesson of the unit they chose. From there, they can go to any other lesson in that unit:

This page talks about the mechanics of creating a lesson page and its content, which includes activities. For information on what to put in your lesson, see [TwoDevelop Develop the Content without Technology].

== What happens on a lesson page ==
A lesson page is where you teach your prepared material and optionally provide an activity to further help students understand the material just presented. Typically, each lesson consists of a short video, text version of the content, and an activity. You embed the video in the lesson page, hosting the video on !YouTube. (See [WorkWithVideo Working with video].) You put the text version in a file at some other URL; for Power Searching, we hosted the text versions as [http://support.google.com/docs/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=49008 Google Docs]. 

Students can watch the video as many times as they like. If they click on *Text version*, a separate browser window appears with that content.

== Page layout ==
This page consists of four areas:
  * The *header* contains 
    * Course icon and name of your course.
    * Horizontal navigation bar, with two tabs on the left (Course and Forum) and an area with the person's address and a Logout link.
    * A breadcrumb indicating where in the course hierarchy this page exists, such as<br>{{{Course > Unit 1 > Lesson 1}}}.
    * The name and number of the unit.
  * A *vertical navigation bar*, consisting of a list of all lessons in the current unit.
  * The *content area* contains:
    * The name of this lesson.
    * A button to access a text version of the lesson.
    * A list of the lesson objectives.
    * The lesson video.
    * Activities, if any.
    * *Back* and *Next* buttons to navigate through the unit. (The first lesson of a unit does not include the *Back* button.)
  * The *footer* contains the same two links as for the registration pages. 

== Create lessons ==
When you create lessons from the browser, the data gets stored in Google App Engine's datastore. Go to *Dashboard > Outline* and click * Add Lesson* on a unit of your choice. Fill out the fields on the page and click *Save*. You have the option of creating the lesson but keeping it private (not viewable to students).

Note: The *Add Lesson* button is unavailable until you create at least one unit.

You edit lessons that already exist in this page as well. Change any details you would like and click *Save*. There is a 4 MB limit on the size of the content you can enter. Usually, this is not a problem.  However, if you need to work around this, include links to the bigger resources instead of directly adding them into the lesson.

== Create activities ==
In the *Lesson Body* textbox, you create the content for your lesson, including activities. Activites are questions that you insert from the [CreateQuestions#Question_Bank_ Question Bank]. You can add the following components as lesson content:

  * Google Doc
  * Google Drive
  * Google Group
  * Google Spreadsheet
  * HTML 5 Video
  * Iframe
  * Image
  * Include
  * Markdown (we this this [http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ markdown syntax])
  * Question
  * Question Group
  * Text File Uploader (maximum size for uploaded files is 4MB)
  * !YouTube videos
  
Add as many components as you like. You can also directly write text into the textbox. By default, you add content in *Lesson Body* through HTML. Some might find it easier to to select them through the Rich Text editor. Click the *Rich Text* button on the right.

Under *Insert Item* in the toolbar, you see three buttons where you can:

  * Add a HTML link
  * Add an image
  * Add the various components (questions, !YouTube videos, etc.) 
    * After you add a component, a placeholder icon shows. When you save and go to the lesson, the component itself shows.

You can add multiple components or mix and match multiple images with multiple components. Here is a video that shows how to add components: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpQqNkRdcck Add course components (4:48)]

Note that there is a 4 MB limit on the size of the content you can enter. Usually, this is not a problem.  However, if you need to work around this, include links to the bigger resources instead of directly adding them into the lesson.
